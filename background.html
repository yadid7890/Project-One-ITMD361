          <h2>Yadid's History</h2>
            <p>
              For eight years of my life, I lived in the coolest farm ever in a house made completely of
              cement. It was the only life I knew until I moved to the city. Adjusting to living in
              Chicago was an exciting yet challenging process. Learning the language and culture took
              time, but I appreciate where I am. If someone were to go back in time and tell a seven
              year old me that I would be in college in the United States, the little me would be in
              disbelief. I am proud of my accomplishments and how far I have come however, and I am
              excited to use my privilege of being here to continue growing.

          <h2>Yadid's Education</h2>
            <p>
              I completed all my higher education in Chicago, IL. I attended Marie Sklodowska Curie
              Metropolitan High School in Brighton Park. I was part of the International Baccalaureate
              Diploma Programme, which allowed me to graduate with a weighed GPA of 5.22. One of my
              greatest accomplishments was graduating as Valedictorian of my high school class.
              Considering that I came from foreign background, I challenged myself and overachieved.

            <p>
              Another great accomplishment from high school was becoming the Team Captain of the
              school's Academic Decathlon Team. As part of the competition, I always finished with the
              awards for Highest Team and Division Scorer at City Championship and Regional
              competitions. I also participated in the city's Science Fair. For my participation and
              research, I was awarded Gold recognition for the Science Fair Symposium portion at the
              State Science Fair (IJAS) and city competition.
            </p>
            <p>
              I decided to attend Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. I am pursuing a Bachelor
              of Science Degree in Applied Analytics with a specialization in Social Sciences. Through
              my studies at Illinois Tech, I have learned how to analyze and effectively communicate
              data sets. I have gained experience extracting data sets with R in RStudio, creating and
              filling databases with SQL in SQL Developer, and analyzing and visualizing data with IBM
              SPSS. I also have extensive experience using Microsoft Access, Excel, Word, and
              PowerPoint, as well as the editor Atom, and using GIT for web development.

          <h2>Yadid's Work Experiences</h2>
            <p>
              My first official job was as a Phonathon Caller at the Illinois Institute of Technology
              Office of Institutional Advancement. For three semesters, I learned how to proactively
              engage a diverse group of alumni and convince them to support the university's fundraising
              goals. I then worked in customer service at the Nike Store in Chicagoâ€™s Magnificent Mile
              as an Under Athlete. Through my 18 months there, I gained more experience on how to
              effectively communicate with diverse groups of people.
            </p>
            <p>
              My first internship was in the summer of 2016 as a Data Collector intern working at Midway
              Airport in partnership with Rico Enterprises and Boingo. As a Data Collector intern I
              learned to effectively gather data from diverse group of busy people while working with a
              partner. For the following two summers I have been interning at the Museum of Science and
              Industry as a Guest Experiences intern. Through my work at this world class museum with an
              annual attendance of over 1.5 million guests, I have improved my skills in communicating
              effectively and proactively to people of all ages and varying background knowledge.

          <h2>Yadid's Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
              Outside of work and school, I enjoy playing adventure games on the PS4, such as Horizon
              Zero Dawn and Detroit Become Human. I also enjoy the Final Fantasy games: I am a big fan
              of the series. I also enjoy watching different TV series such as Game of Thrones, The Man
              in the High Castle, and Bob's Burgers. I also have two wonderful dogs that I take care of.
              Their names are Bonbon and Oliver-- they are both Australian Cattle Dogs. Bonbon loves to
              play fetch and Oliver loves licking and making a mess with his saliva. I love them both
              dearly.
